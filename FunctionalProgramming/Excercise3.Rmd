## Lists of Functions

1. Implement a summary function that works like base::summary(), but uses a list of functions. Modify the function so it returns a closure, making it possible to use it as a function factory.

>I havent completed this yet, sharing my incomplete/ incorrect code

```{R}
object.list = list(df = data.frame(),fr=factor(), mx = matrix())
summary.new = function(y){
  parse(text = paste("summary",as.character(class(y)),sep = "."))
}
summary.new.list = lapply(object.list, summary.new)
```

2. Which of the following commands is equivalent to with(x, f(z))?

    x$f(x$z).
    f(x$z).
    x$f(z).
    f(z).
    It depends.

>f(x$z) or f(z)
